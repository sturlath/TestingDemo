## About the solution
This is a basic N-tier web and UWP solution that most developers are probably used to. It relies heavily on the usage of dependency injection by using constructor injection with interfaces.

Later it might be interesting to have a testing demo using [Clean/Onion Architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/modern-web-apps-azure-architecture/common-web-application-architectures)
